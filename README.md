A collection of interactive Jupyter Notebook mathematical demonstrations, sorted according to the class that they are most likely to be useful for. This is meant as a follow-up to my [Mathematica Class Demonstrations](https://github.com/adam-rumpf/mathematica-class-demonstrations) project, remade using Jupyter Notebooks for ease of access.
