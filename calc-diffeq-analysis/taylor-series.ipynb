This could be because the real function we're interested in is computationally expensive to evaluate, or because it leads to overly-complicated analytical results, or because it's actually unknown (as is the case in solving differential equations). However, as long as we have a bit of information about our function for one particular input, and as long as we only need to move a small distance away from that single known input, we may be able to reasonably approximate its value within a small range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, suppose we have a function $f(x)$ that we would like to approximate around some input value $a$. Our goal is to find a \"simple\" function $p(x)$ that is \"approximately equal\" to $f(x)$ for values of $x$ \"near\" $a$. That is,\n",
