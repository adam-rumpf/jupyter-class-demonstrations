    "\n",
    "In computational mathematics it's often useful to approximate a complicated function using a simpler one. This could be because the real function we're interested in is computationally expensive to evaluate, or because it leads to overly-complicated analytical results, or because it's actually unknown (as is the case in solving differential equations). However, as long as we have a bit of information about our function for one particular input, we may be able to reasonably approximate its value near that input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, suppose we have a function $f(x)$ that we would like to approximate around some input value $a$. Our goal is to find a \"simple\" function $p(x)$ that is \"approximately equal\" to $f(x)$ for values of $x$ \"near\" $a$. That is,\n",

    "There are lots of reasonable choices for what kind of function we could choose $p$ to be, but we happen to get some particularly nice results when we look at the case of $p$ being a polynomial."
