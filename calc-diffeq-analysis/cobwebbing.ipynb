    "## Equilibrium Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important questions to be answered about a dynamical systems model is what the expected long-term behavior is like. In the case of a population model we might want to know whether the population will crash to nothing, or explode without bound, or settle at a finite value. This behavior might in turn depend on some of the parameters of the model, in which case we might want to know how different combinations of parameters affect the long-term behavior of the system. These kinds of _qualitative_ rather than _quantitative_ questions are one of the big differences between a dynamical systems course and a differential equations course. While differential equations tends to focus almost entirely on analytically or numerically solving systems in order to be able to write the solution $x(t)$ in closed form, dynamical systems tends to focus on questions that can be answered without actually needing to explicitly solve the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful tools in studying dynamical systems is _equilibrium analysis_. An _equilibrium_ of a dynamical system is a solution that does not change once reached, meaning that if the system were to begin at an equilibrium solution, it would remain there forever. It is possible for an equilibrium to be either _stable_, meaning that nearby solutions tend to move towards it, or _unstable_, meaning that nearby solutions tend to move away from it. Other, more complicated behaviors (like saddle points, limit cycles, or periodic orbits) are also possible, but one of the main things we usually want to know about a dynamical system is what the equilibria are, and whether they are stable or unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the defining characteristic of an equilibrium, $x^*$, is that the system doesn't change once it is reached, we can define an equilibrium solution to be any solution for which the difference (or the derivative, in the continuous case) is zero, i.e.\n",

    "### Example: Discrete Logistic Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most well-known discrete population models is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map\" target=\"_blank\">discrete logistic map</a>, which is the discrete analog of the continuous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function#Logistic_differential_equation\" target=\"_blank\">logistic growth model</a>. Both provide a simple model for a population whose growth is limited by some carrying capacity (for example, due to limited space or resources).\n",

    "\n",
    "To analyze this model, we can immediately see that there are exactly two equilibria, $x^* = 0$ and $x^* = L$, since both result in the growth rate $\\dot{x}(t)$ becoming zero. When the population is small, $L - x(t)$ is nearly equal to just $L$, and the equation is nearly equal to $\\dot{x}(t) = L r x(t)$, which is the differential equation for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth#Differential_equation\" target=\"_blank\">exponential growth</a>. When the population is just under $L$, $L - x(t)$ is nearly zero, and the rate of growth slows. When the population is larger than $L$, then $L - x(t)$ is negative and $\\dot{x}(t)$ becomes negative, meaning that the population shrinks. Combining all of these observations we can conclude that $0$ is an unstable equilibrium while $L$ is a stable equilibrium."

    "For example, consider the case of $r=2.5$ and $L=1$ (note that this does not necessarily mean that the population is limited to $1$ individual, since the unit of $x$ is unspecified). Then if our initial population were $x_0 = 0.6$, our next population would be $x_1 = 2.5 x_0 (1-x_0) = 2.5 (0.6)(1-0.6) = 1.2$. After that our population would be $x_2 = 2.5 x_1 (1-x_1) = 2.5 (1.2) (1-1.2) = 0.6$, which is equal to the initial population $x_0$, meaning that from this point onward the population will continue to oscillate between $0.6$ and $1.2$ forever. Complicated cycles like this are common in discrete dynamical systems, which can make them difficult to analyze."

    "Finding equilibria is relatively straightforward, but determining whether an equilibrium is stable or unstable is another matter. Intuitively we could try to get a rough idea of the stability by plugging a value \"close to\" $x^*$ into the difference equation and then evaluating it for a few iterations to see whether the solutions get closer to or farther from $x^*$, but that might require going through some lengthy calculations. Fortunately there's a quick and easy graphical method that lets us approximate these calculations visually."
